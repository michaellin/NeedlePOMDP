    "In this tutorial, we try to provide a simple example of how to define a Markov decision process (MDP) problem using the [POMDPs.jl](https://github.com/sisl/POMDPs.jl) interface. After defining the problem in this way, you will be able to use the solvers that the interface supports. In this tutorial, we will show you how to use the value iteration and the Monte Carlo Tree Search solvers that the POMDPs.jl interface supports. We assume that you have some knowledge of basic programming, but are not necessarily familiar with all the features that exist in Julia. We try to cover the many language specific features used in POMDPs.jl in this tutorial. We do assume that you know the grid world problem, and are familiar with the formal defintion of the MDP.  Let's get started!"

    "In Grid World, we are trying to control an agent who has trouble moving in the desired direction. In our problem, we have a four reward states on a $10\\times 10$ grid. Each position on the grid represents a state, and the positive reward states are terminal (the agent stops recieveing reward after reaching them). The agent has four actions to choose from: up, down, left, right. The agent moves in the desired direction with a probability of 0.7, and with a probability of 0.1 in each of the remaining three directions. The problem has the following form:\n",

    "## MDP Type\n",
    "An MDP must contain a state space and an action space. In POMDPs.jl, we define an MDP type by parametarizing it (to read more about parametric types look [here](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/types/#man-parametric-types)) with states and actions both of which are their own types. For example, if our states and actions are both represented by integers we can define our MDP type in the following way:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "type MyMDP <: MDP{Int64, Int64} # MDP{StateType, ActionType}\n",
    "\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "The MyMDP type is inheriting from an abstract MDP type define in POMDPs.jl. If you are interested in in learning more about the type system and inheritance in Jullia check out [this](http://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/2015/02/04/types-and-inheritance-in-julia/) blog post. Let's first define our states and actions, and then we'll go through defining our Grid World MDP type. "
